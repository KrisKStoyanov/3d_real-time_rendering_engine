## Welcome to my largest project yet

Slingshot is an aspiration to achieve a product worth of several years of studying graphics programming starting from 2016. My aim is to combine multiple 3D Graphics APIs under one banner in an application which I can use to continuously hone my skills in this craft.

### D3D11, OpenGL, D3D12, Vulkan <-> CUDA, OptiX, OpenCL

Those are some of the APIs and platforms I currently plan to integrate at some point.
Thanks for stopping by and I hope you find what you are looking for.
