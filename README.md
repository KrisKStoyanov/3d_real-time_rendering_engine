## Welcome

This is where I update and maintain an ongoing project related to the development of a 3D graphics engine. I use this project as an opportunity to keep my programming skills in shape while learning and testing new technologies related to the game development industry that I find interesting.

## Build Instructions

	1.Open Slingshot.sln
	2.Select solution config & platform
	3.Build
	2.Copy .cso files from inside solution directory to executable folder directory (bin/[Config]-[Platform], e.g. bin/Release-x64)
	3.Copy .dll files from inside redist folder to executable folder directory 
	3.Run Slingshot.exe
